    Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass Surgery: A Summary
    
    What it is:
    Gastric bypass surgery, also called Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, is done 
    in three steps. First, the surgeon staples your stomach, creating a 
    small pouch in the upper section. The staples make your stomach much 
    smaller, so you eat less because you feel full sooner.

    Next, the surgeon divides your small intestine into two parts and 
    attaches the lower part directly to the small stomach pouch. Food will 
    bypass most of your stomach and the upper part of your small intestine, 
    so your body absorbs fewer calories.

    The surgeon then reconnects the upper part of the small intestine to a 
    new location farther down on the lower part of the small intestine. 
    This allows digestive juices in the stomach to flow from the bypassed 
    part of the small intestine to the lower part of the small intestine, 
    so that food can be fully digested. The bypass changes hormones, 
    bacteria, and other substances in the gastrointestinal tract that 
    may affect appetite and metabolism. Gastric bypass is difficult to 
    reverse, although a surgeon may do it if medically necessary.

    Pros:
    - Greater weight loss than gastric band
    - No foreign objects placed in body

    Cons:
    - Difficult to reverse
    - Higher chance of vitamin and iron shortage than gastric band or 
      gastric sleeve
    - Higher chance of surgery-related problems than gastric band
    - May increase risk of alcohol use disorder

    What to expect before surgery:
    Before surgery, you will meet with several health care professionals, 
    such as an internist, a dietitian, a psychiatrist or psychologist, 
    and a bariatric surgeon. These health care professionals also will advise 
    you to become more active and adopt a healthy eating plan before and 
    after surgery. Losing weight and bringing your blood glucose—also 
    known as blood sugar—levels closer to normal before surgery may lower 
    your chances of having surgery-related problems.

    What to expect after surgery:
    After surgery, you will need to rest and recover. Walking and moving 
    around the house may help you recover more quickly. Start slowly and 
    follow your health care professional’s advice about the type of 
    physical activity you can do safely. As you feel more comfortable, 
    add more physical activity.

    After surgery, you will probably be started on a liquid diet. Over 
    several weeks, you will move to a soft diet that includes such foods 
    as cottage cheese, yogurt, or soup. Eventually you will begin consuming 
    solid foods again. Your health care professional will tell you which 
    foods and beverages you may have and which ones you should avoid. 
    You will need to eat small meals and chew your food well. You will 
    need to take dietary supplements that your health care professional 
    prescribes to make sure you are getting enough vitamins and minerals.
